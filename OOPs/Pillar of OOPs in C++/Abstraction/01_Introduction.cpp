    -> When gone through the book, we can say that "Abstraction" mean "Implementation Hiding" i.e. Hiding the essential processes like how a program works and all the behind the scenes from the user.
    -> For example, the house owner dont require to know which bricks are used to build the house, how many days have the house been watered, how much cememnt is used overally to build the complete house etc etc. He just need to know the price of the house not the way or the processes the engineers have gone through to make the house complete.
    -> Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of OOP in C++. It means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
    -> It refers to providing only necessary information about the outside world's data, hiding details or implementation.
    -> Real life Example ------
        When A send an email to B, A just clicked send and got the success message. How data is transmitted over the network to B is hidden from A.
    -> Abstraction with classes------
        We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. The class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. A class can decide which data members will be visible to the outside world and which is not.
    -> Abstraction using Header Files------
        One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. 
        For example, the pow() method present in the math.h header file. To calculate the power of any number we just need to call the pow() present in math.h header file and pass the number as argument without knowing the umderlying algorithm according to which the function is calculating the power of the numbers.
    -> Abstraction using access specifiers-----
        Access specifiers are the main pillars of Abstraction. We can use access specifiers to enforce restrictions on class members.
