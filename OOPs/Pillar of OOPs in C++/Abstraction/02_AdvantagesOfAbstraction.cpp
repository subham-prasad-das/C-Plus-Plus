/*

    Abstraction in OOPs while implementing in C++ is very much advantageous. Its advantages can be described through =>
        1. Only the maker of any data or function or program can make changes to them, no one else can.
        2. It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the background details of he program or function.
        3. It also increases the reusability of the code.
        4. It avoids the duplication of the code.
