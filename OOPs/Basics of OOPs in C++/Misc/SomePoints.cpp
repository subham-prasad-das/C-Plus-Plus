-> In C, We just had the concept of the structure. There we used it for the derivation of User-Defined Data type. The problem with that thing is that it was accessed by one and all functions made in that program. That is it was Public by default.
-> Thats why C++ (C With Extensions) came with the extenssion of the structure i.e. CLAsSeS, which as the structure used object for callling it and doing the user required job.
-> By then C++ Introduced Object-Oriented Programming to the programming world.

||-> Why Object-Oriented Programming?
    -> C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented programming to C language
    -> As the size of the program increases readability, maintainability, and bug-free nature of the program decrease.
    -> This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedure (hence  the name procedural programming language)
    -> As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem adequately was high
    -> Also, data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised
    -> Using classes solves this problem by modeling program as a real-world scenario
||-> Difference between Procedure Oriented Programming and Object-Oriented Programming
    -> Procedure Oriented Programming
        - Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
        - The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data
        - Functions can either use local or global data
        - Data moves openly from function to function
    -> Object-Oriented Programming
        - Works on the concept of classes and object
        - A class is a template to create objects
        - Treats data as a critical element
        - Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects
||-> Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming
    -> Classes - Basic template for creating objects
    -> Objects – Basic run-time entities
    -> Data Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
    -> Data Abstraction - Separation of concerns
    -> Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others (best example of code reusability)
    -> Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms
    -> Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs i.e the code flow will get known at the runtime. It is also called as late binding. 
    -> Message Passing – message (Information) call format
||-> Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming
    -> Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
    -> Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
    -> Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference
    -> Software complexity can be easily managed
